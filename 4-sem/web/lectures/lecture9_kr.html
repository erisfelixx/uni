                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>It marked the convergence of two companies which had had many points of contact throughout their history. Ferdinand Porsche (1875-1951) was an innovator whose ground-breaking designs made him one of the great figures in the automotive history of the first half of the 20th century. He began looking into the construction of electric vehicles as early as 1898.</p>
                    <p>The Lohner-Porsche featuring a wheel hub mounted motor had a range of 50 kilometres, and was a big hit at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris. In the same year, Porsche developed the Semper Vivus, the world’s first functional hybrid vehicle to go into production.</p>
                    <h3>Design</h3>
                    <p>After having undertaken a number of minor projects, in 1933 the design company was awarded the lucrative contract to build a race car for Auto Union. </p>

                    <p>Following its launch in September 1964, the new 911 model was to become the cornerstone of the Porsche brand. Seven generations of the model have been built at the facility in Zuffenhausen near Stuttgart since start of production. The 911 has become a by-word for fulfilment of the automotive dream.</p>
